## Github Profiler

With a change to the status quo this week there will be not right or wrong answer ðŸ˜¬.

This week is all about either playing with new technology or new features of an existing technology. And, this week it is all about the browser.

### Aim of the game

The GitHub api is open for public use to gather public information on a profile, you can see this by checking out [my profile](https://api.github.com/users/simonfl3tcher). What I would like you to do this week, is create a small application that does two things:

1. Allows you to type into an input and search for a user. Ideally this should show results as and when you type them (think... typeahead). For more API information on this check out the [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users).

2. Once you find a user, you should be able to click on them. By clicking on them, it should take you to a separate page (route) which displays the profile username and picture.

## What I would like to see?

A pull request as usual, with a screencast of it working will suffice this week ðŸ™‚.
