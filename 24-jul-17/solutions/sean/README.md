# CSS Animation challenge

I started out creating the images in the code with SVG shapes, but soon realised that it was a bit too tedious and taking way too long. I then took a screenshot of the gif and placed it in Illustrator, copied the shapes, dimensions and colours and exported them.

I added the images via ```img``` tags and then created the animations, referencing the original gif for timings and movement.
