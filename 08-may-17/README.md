# Character Frequency

We have recorded a repeating message signal. This is kept in `input.txt`. However, the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover. **Almost**.

It is your job to figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose we had recorded the following messages:

```
pedaratwqr
drvgeerqwv
eandsrerec
pyovrdrmru
arevrstmtr
tsrnevmyyl
sdttrayuer
prortamiyk
nsodtsymur
ntnadagtik
svegvahfej
tesnrtmvph
pntsrdwmlg
vrdeareher
dvrgeaxfef
enararmmgv
```

The most common character in the first column is p; in the second, r; in the third, o, and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, programmer.

Given the input in `input.txt`, what is the error-corrected version of the message being sent?
