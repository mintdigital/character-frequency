# Mint Weekly Tech Challenge

Each week one of us will provide a problem to solve, this can be anything from an algorithmic problem, to a problem we have struggled to solve this week, to something that plays with a piece of technology that we have not played with before.

The aim is to allow us to learn from each other about how we each choose to solve the problem, we can use new technology that we haven’t used before, different languages, and play around with things outside of our skill set. Ultimately it will push our boundaries and we will be working with tech that we don’t enjoy and tech we love but that is part of the fun.

### How it works

Each week a member of the Mint development team will think of a problem. This problem needs to take no longer than two hours to complete. If you struggle to complete the challenge in two hours, that is fine, it likely means either the problem was too hard, or you can learn from another member of the team. You can undertake this challenge at any time in the week but a submission must be made by 5pm on Friday.

### Submission

As you can see from the repository, it it structured into weeks. Within that week you will see the challenge for the week in the README. From there branch off `master` and create a directory as your name within the `solutions` directory. From there you can create your solution and all solutions from all members of the team can be merged.

Create a pull request, describing how you solved the problem and what you would do if you had more time. Or just use the pull request template provided by GitHub.
