# Character Frequency

We have recorded a repeating message signal. This is kept in `input.txt`. However, the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover. **Almost**.

It is your job to figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose we had recorded the following messages:

pedadatwqr
drvgeerqwv
eandsrerec
pyovrdrmru
arevrstmtr
tsrnevmyyl
sdttsayuer
prortamiyk
nsodtsymur
ntnadagtik
svegvahfej
tesnrtmvph
pntsndwmlg
vrdeareher
dvrgeaxfef
enararmmgv

The most common character in the first column is p; in the second, r; in the third, o, and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, programmer.

Given the input in `input.txt`, what is the error-corrected version of the message being sent?

### What we would like you to do

We would like you to take the time to figure out what the message is. You can use ANY language you like, however we tend to use Ruby, Elixir or JavaScript so these languages would be preferable otherwise we may struggle to follow along ðŸ˜‰.

Once you have figured it out, we would like you to submit a Pull Request to this repository. Using the Pull Request template please take the time to fill out the information so we can ask the right questions.

### Questions

This test is purposefully opaque, we want to see how you handle and think about the problem in hand. We expect you to have questions. First try to answer these questions yourself. If you are really stuck, please feel free to submit a WIP Pull Request and we can look to point you in the right direction from there.

If you find yourself at a loose end, please feel free to email me simon@mintdigital.com
